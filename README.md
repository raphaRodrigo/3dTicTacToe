# 3dTicTacToe

This is a simple example of a Unity game made with Bolt Visual Scripting.

It's a Tic Tac Toe game in a 3x3x3 isometric playfield. There's a total of 49 ways of winning a match, so understanding of the three planes as a whole is a must for beating your opponent. By now it's best enjoyed as a two-player game, since the the A.I. isn't implemented yet.
