# 3dTicTacToe

This is a simple example prototype of a Unity game made with Bolt Visual Scripting for studying purposes.

It's a Tic Tac Toe game in a 3x3x3 isometric playfield. There's a total of 49 ways of winning a match, so understanding of the three planes as a whole is a must for beating your opponent. By now it's best enjoyed as a two-player game, since the the A.I. hasn't been implemented yet. Also, there's an option for viewing the playfield as the classic 3x3 version.
